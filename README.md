This is a fork of StorYBook, a free, summary-based open source software for
novelists and authors that helps you to keep the overview over the strands
while writing a book, a novel or a story. StorYBook assists you to structure
your book.

Rather than other products, StorYBook let you write your story with the
software of your choice, no matter whether this is OpenOffice, Word or LyX.
StorYBook is totally independent. The only links needed are the chapter numbers.
