

This is a fork of StorYBook, a free, summary-based open source software for
novelists and authors that helps you to keep the overview over the strands
while writing a book, a novel or a story. StorYBook assists you to structure
your book.

Rather than other products, StorYBook let you write your story with the
software of your choice, no matter whether this is OpenOffice, Word or LyX.
StorYBook is totally independent. The only links needed are the chapter numbers.

===================================================================

This is from the 3.x version of StorYBook.
The 4.x version (which I couldn't find the source for) is now up
on sourceforge at http://ostorybook.sourceforge.net/

===================================================================

  If you see just this text after the installation and nothing
  else happens, you probably
  - have not installed Java.
  - have installed an old version of Java.

  Please install or update Java. See
  
  http://www.java.com/en/download
  
  for more details.
